👋 Hi, I’m @Coben2: A young aspiring XR expert/enthusiasts' SECOND github. Double the repositories = double the fun.🥲
👀 I’m interested in making my own studio geared towards merging education and XR through immersive technology.
🌱 I’m currently learning Unity Development from Circuit Stream. Afterwards, I wan't to learn Python and OpenCV.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with anyone willing to reach out. I have a diverse skillset and will be valueable to any team.
📫 How to reach me? I am always on my computer (fortunate for you but not my eyes...or back haha). My email is j.j.viser1@email.com.
